# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [@Node.js (version16 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/en) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting Started

1- Clone the repository:

```js
git clone https://github.com/Mazen-Ahmed12/mini-dashboard.git
cd mini-dashboard
```

2- Install dependencies:

```js
yarn install
```

3- Start the development server:

```js
yarn dev
```

This will launch the app at http://localhost:5173/ by default.
